## About

This project's Idea is to allow people to basically search to see if the item is recyclable. A simple, minimal, and fast way to find the right way to recycle and find the right facts.

## Why?

Recycling isn't always easy. I'm confused, and you are maybe. It's time there's a simpler way. Although, websites like this exist already, it's not exactly the best.

We want to make a simple fast and easy way to find what items are and are not.'

# Greenzone

We have 2 main repos.

[Site](https://github.com/Greenzoneorg/site), the site page what is the front-end and main website
[Api](https://github.com/Greenzoneorg/Api), this is the API, I think for Greenzone.
